![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/outfoxx/PotentCodables)
## A potent set of implementations and extension to the Swift `Codable` system

### Why?
The framework aims to solve three major pain points experienced with Swift's `Codable` system:

* Allow decoding and/or encoding values of unknown structure (e.g. any encoded value)
* Support polymorphic type encoding/decoding while still allowing Swift to implement `Codable` 
* Reduce the complexity and amount of code required to implement and test new serialization formats
* Provide a library of fully featured implementations of popular serialization formats


## Integration

### Swift Package Manager 
PotentCodables currently supports Swift Package Manager for project integration. Add a package dependency similar to the following:  
```swift
  .package(url: "https://github.com/outfoxx/PotentCodables.git", from: "1.0.0")
```


The package provides multiple libraries corresponding to the core library and each format that is provided:

* `PotentCodables` is the core library to be used by format implementors
* `PotentJSON` provides JSON format support
* `PotentCBOR` provide CBOR format support
* `PotentASN1` provides ASN.1 support
* `PotentYAML` provides YAML 1.2 support


## Usage

### Using Encoders/Decoders

If your only goal is to use one of the provided implementations of a serialization format, not much information is needed beyond the
name of the encoder/decoder pair that you are seeking to use.  All of the implementations provided by the package are 100% compatible with
Swift's `Codable` system and they all intentionally mimic the interface of Swift's native encoders & Decoder
(e.g. `Foundation.JSONEncoder` and `Foundation.JSONDecoder`).

For example encoding to CBOR is essentially the same as encoding with Swift's standard JSONEncoder
```swift
let data = try CBOREncoder.default.encode(myValue)
```
#### Provided Formats

- YAML - `YAMLEncoder`/`YAMLDecoder` or `YAML.Encoder`/`YAML.Decoder`
  A conformant [YAML 1.2](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.1/) implementation implemented via
  [libfyaml](https://github.com/pantoniou/libfyaml). Due to the fact that JSON is a subset of YAML 1.2 the decoder
  can parse and decode YAML & JSON documents.

- JSON - `JSONEncoder`/`JSONDecoder` or `JSON.Encoder`/`JSON.Decoder`
  A conformant [JSON](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259) implementation that is a drop-in replacement for Swift's JSON encoder and
  decoder provided by Foundation. These implementations offer enhancements to what items can be encoded to (e.g. to/from Strings
  and to/from native value trees) and offer performance enhancements when using `AnyValue`.  

- CBOR - `CBOREncoder`/`CBORDecoder` or `CBOR.Encoder`/`CBOR.Decoder`
  A conformant implementation of the [CBOR](https://cbor.io) serialization format written in pure Swift.

- ASN.1 - `ASN1Encoder`/`ASN1Decoder` or `ASN1.Encoder`/`ASN1.Decoder`
  A conformant implementation of the [ASN.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One) serialization format written in pure Swift.
  ASN.1's position based format can be very ambiguous, even so it is commonly used in situations that require absolute unambiguity. To
  overcome these issues the ASN1Encoder and ASN1Decoder require a schema be passed to their initializer that directs the encoding and/or decoding. More
  information is available [here](Docs/ASN1Schemas.md)

- AnyValue - `AnyValueEncoder`/`AnyValueDecoder` or `AnyValue.Encoder`/`AnyValue.Decoder`
  An in-memory transcoding implementation for working with unstructured values using `AnyValue`.

#### Extended Interfaces

All provided encoders and decoders come with an extended set of methods that allow different targets and sources when encoding and
decoding.

Encoders provide these methods
```swift
// Encoding to value tree - Supported by all encoders
func encodeTree<T: Encodable>(_ value: T) throws -> Value

// Encoding to data - supported by text & binary format encoders
func encode<T: Encodable>(_ value: T) throws -> Data

// Encoding to string - supported by text format encoders
func encode<T: Encodable>(_ value: T) throws -> String  
```

Decoders provide these methods
```swift
// Decoding from a value tree - supported by all decoders
func decodeTree<T: Decodable>(_ type: T.Type, from value: Value) throws -> T
func decodeTreeIfPresent<T: Decodable>(_ type: T.Type, from value: Value) throws -> T?

// Decoding from data - supported by text & binary format decoders
func decode<T: Decodable>(_ type: T.Type, from data: Data) throws -> T
func decodeIfPresent<T: Decodable>(_ type: T.Type, from data: Data) throws -> T?

// Decoding from string - supported by text format encoders
func decode<T: Decodable>(_ type: T.Type, from data: String) throws -> T  
func decodeIfPresent<T: Decodable>(_ type: T.Type, from data: String) throws -> T?
```

##### Combine

When used on Apple platforms where the Combine framework is available, all the encoders conform to Combine's
`TopLevelEncoder` and all decoders conform to its `TopLevelDecoder`.

### Polymorphic Encoding/Decoding

`Codable` encoders and decoders are a great tool and very convenient. Unfortunately using them with polymorphic types is cumbersome,
to say the least, and near impossible in a lot of other cases.

PotentCodables provides `Ref` and `EmbeddedRef` to make encoding/decoding polymorphic types very easy. The reference wrappers are
designed to work with concrete type and protcols alike.

`Ref` is used to decode values that are "wrapped" with a type name. For example, given JSON similar to the following:
```javascript
{ "@type" : "MyApp.Foo", "value" : { "name" : "A Value" } }
```

`Ref` can be used to decode a value with little extra code
```swift
protocol FooBar {
  var name: String { get }
}

struct Foo: FooBar, Codable {
  let name: String
}

struct Bar: FooBar, Codable {
  let count: Int
}

DefaultTypeIndex.setAllowedTypes([Foo.self, Bar.self]) // Authorize & map allowed types for polymorphic decoding

let val = try JSONDecoder.default.decode(Ref.self).as(FooBar.self)  // Decode ref and use the `as` utility to cast it or throw
```

To encode a value with the required structure and inserting the Swift type name simply use `Ref.Value` during encoding:
```swift
let data = try JSONEncoder.default.encode(Ref.Value(val))
```

`EmbeddedRef`, which includes `EmbeddedRef.Value`, is also provided and is used the exact same way as `Ref`. The difference is that
`EmbeddedRef` embeds the type name along side the encoded values other keys. For example, the example JSON above would resemble the
following with the key embedded:
```javascript
{ "@type" : "MyApp.Foo", "name" : "A Value" }
```

 `EmbeddedRef` requires the value it encodes to use a keyed-container.  Unkeyed and single-value containers cannot be used with
it, but they can be used with `Ref`.


The documentation for `Ref` and `EmbeddedRef` provide a lot of details on their usage as well as documentation of how to customize the
keys used during encoding/decoding. 

#### Type serialization & lookup
By default the type serialization & lookup mechanism (see `Ref`  & `DefaultTypeIndex` code documentation) disallows all types to be decoded.
This is to ensure that decoding is secure as only specific/authorized types can be decoded. Additionally, the index mechanism, by default,
uses a type id that does not include the Swift module name so as to ensure stable type ids across modules, frameworks, and languages.

The means that you must explicity map allowed classes prior to using polymorphic decoding. This is done as simply as:
```swift
DefaultTypeIndex.setAllowedTypes([Foo.self, Bar.self])
```
This generates a type id for each type (`Foo` & `Bar`) and upates the map to allow only those types provided. Note that each call to `setAllowedTypes`
overwrites the current set of allowed types and as such applications should register them in a single place.

Alternatively you can implement and provide a custom type index (see `Ref`, `CustomRef` & `TypeIndex` code documentation). If you have
an alternate means of looking up types.

##### Allowed Types in Frameworks

The default type index is designed to be convenient and safe for simple applications. Unfortunately this means frameworks **must** use a custom
type index to ensure the types it expects are registered and reduce the chance of inadvertantly creating security vulnerabilities.

### Raw Value Container

Each decoder has an in memory representation known as the "tree" value. The great thing about tree values is that they hold
the values in their exact serialized representation.  For example, `JSON` tree values store numbers as a specialized `JSON.Number`
that stores the exact number value as a string along with a number of other properties for helping the conversion of strings to
integer or floating point numbers. Accessing this `JSON.Number` and reading the exact decimal value serialized in JSON is
 available from tree values. 

The decoders support accessing the tree value using specializations of the protocol `TreeValueDecodingContainer` which
extends the  `SingleValueDecodingContainer` protocol. 

Decoding `JSON` values using the `TreeValueDecodingContainer` as follows:
```swift
func init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
let treeContainer = try decoder.singleValuedContainer() as! TreeValueDecodingContainer
self.jsonValue = try treeContainer.decodeTreeValue() as! JSON
}
```

Each tree value has the ability to "unwrap" itself (using it's `unwrapped` property) into it's the best available standard Swift type,
returned as an  `Any`. As an example, unwrappingthe the JSON value `123.456` result in a Swift `Double`.

Tree values are returned as an `Any` to allow easy support any possible tree value. For this reason the
`TreeValueDecodingContainer` has a convenience method to access the unwrapped tree value without excessive casting.

Decoding unwrapped `JSON` values using the `TreeValueDecodingContainer` as follows:
```swift
func init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
let treeContainer = try decoder.singleValuedContainer() as! TreeValueDecodingContainer
self.value = try treeContainer.decodeUnwrappedValue()
}
```

### `AnyValue` - Unstructured Values

Sometimes it is necessary to decode values of any type or that can take on any structure; unfortunately Swift's `Codable` is not well suited
for this purpose. PotentCodables provides `AnyValue` to fill the gap.

Using `AnyValue` is simple, just use it wherever you would normally use an `Any`. Since `AnyValue` supports `Codable` everything else
works as normal including Swift's automatic codable generation.
```swift
struct Account : Codable {
  let name: String
  let data: AnyValue                  // `data` can store and scalar or complex value
  let dataDict: [String: AnyValue]    // `dataDict` is required to be a dictionary of name to any values
  let dataArray: [AnyValue]           // `dataArray` is required to be an array of any values
}
```

The example `Account` struct above has a `data` property that can take on any value supported by the codable system. For example
when decoding from JSON, any value or tree of values (including _null_, _bool_, _string_, _number_, _arrray_ or _object_) could be saved in
the `data` property. Encoding the same `Account` value back to JSON will produce equivalent serialized JSON regardless of the contents
of the `data` field.

`AnyValue` has lots of features to make building and using them natural in Swift, like "dynamic member lookup" to access fields of a
`AnyValue.dictionary`. See the documentation for complete details.

**Performance**
Although `AnyValue` is compatible with any conformant `Codable` encoder or decoder, PotentCodables decoders specifically have shortcuts
to decode the proper values in a more performant fashion and should be used when possible.
